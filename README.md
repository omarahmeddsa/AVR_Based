# AVR_Based
# AVR Repository

Welcome to the AVR Repository! This repository is dedicated to providing AVR-based solutions, including drivers for microcontrollers (specifically for ATmega32 with an 8MHz clock), problem-solving examples in C, and various AVR projects with Proteus simulations.

## Table of Contents
1. [AVR Drivers](#avr-drivers)
2 [AVR Projects](#avr-projects)

## AVR Drivers
The `AVR_Drivers` folder contains essential drivers needed to interface with microcontrollers based on AVR, particularly optimized for ATmega32 with an 8MHz clock. These drivers are designed to facilitate easy integration into your projects.

## AVR Projects
The `AVR Projects` section includes various projects for AVR microcontrollers. Each project folder contains a Proteus simulation file and a well-commented `SRC_Code` file. The simulation file allows you to visualize and test the project in a virtual environment, while the source code provides detailed comments to help you understand and customize the code for your specific needs.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this repository. If you have any questions, issues, or improvements, please don't hesitate to raise them in the respective sections or create new discussions.

Happy coding!
